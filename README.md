# iRacing Fuel Calculator written in Angular 6.

A small app to help sim racers work out how much fuel they will need for either a timed race or a race for a set number of laps. Helpful to work out pit strategy for long races or just to know how little fuel you need to carry for a sprint race. Can be used for other sims such as ACC and RF2 but was built with iRacing specifically in mind.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build. Use `--base-href` if placing app in sub directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
